# SOC Lab: Network Traffic Analysis

This project demonstrates basic network traffic analysis skills relevant to a Tier 1 SOC Analyst role.

## Objective
To analyze ICMP and DNS traffic using Kali Linux and Wireshark.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Wireshark
- ping
- ip a

## Lab Steps

### 1. Checked Network Interface
Used the command `ip a`

### 2. Generated Traffic
Generated traffic using `ping google.com`

### 3. Captured Traffic in Wireshark
Captured packets on the eth0 interface.

### 4. Applied Filters
Applied filters `icmp` and `dns`

## Security Relevance
Understanding ICMP and DNS traffic helps detect:
- Network reconnaissance
- DNS tunneling
- Ping sweeps

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic analysis
- Packet inspection using Wireshark
- ICMP and DNS traffic filtering
- Linux command line usage
- Basic SOC investigation workflow
